# DATA-STRUCTURES-AND-ALGORITHMS
**Introduction**

This repository is dedicated to enhancing my problem-solving skills by tackling various data structure challenges and applying the algorithms I've been learning. Over time, I've practiced and refined my approach to solving these problems, recognizing their importance in the field.

**What are Data Structures?**

Data structures are ways to organize, manage, and store data to enable efficient access and modification. They are essential for handling data in a structured way, making it easier to perform various operations on it.

**Common Data Structures:**

**Arrays:**

A collection of elements stored in contiguous memory locations.

Fast access to elements, but fixed size.

Example: int[] arr = {1, 2, 3, 4};

**Linked Lists:**

A collection of nodes where each node contains a data element and a reference to the next node.

Dynamic size, but slower access compared to arrays.

Example: Singly Linked List, Doubly Linked List.

**Stacks:**

A linear data structure that follows the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle.

Example: Undo operation in text editors.

**Queues:**

A linear data structure that follows the First In, First Out (FIFO) principle.

Example: Print queue.

**Trees:**

A hierarchical data structure with nodes connected by edges.

Example: Binary Trees, Binary Search Trees (BST), AVL Trees.

**Graphs:**

A collection of nodes connected by edges.

Used to model relationships and networks.

Example: Social networks, transportation networks.

**Hash Tables:**

A data structure that maps keys to values for efficient lookup.

Example: Dictionaries in Python, Maps in Java.

**What are Algorithms?**
Algorithms are step-by-step procedures or formulas for solving problems. They are the heart of computer science, enabling the execution of tasks and solving problems in a structured way.

**Common Types of Algorithms:**
**Sorting Algorithms:**

Organize data in a specific order.

Example: Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort.

**Searching Algorithms:**

Find specific data within a structure.

Example: Linear Search, Binary Search.

**Dynamic Programming:**

Solve problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems and storing results for future use.

Example: Fibonacci sequence, Knapsack problem.

**Greedy Algorithms:**

Make the best choice at each step to find the global optimum.

Example: Dijkstra's Algorithm, Prim's Algorithm.

**Graph Algorithms:**

Operate on graphs to find paths, cycles, and other properties.

Example: Depth-First Search (DFS), Breadth-First Search (BFS).

**Why Learn DSA?**

Efficiency: Write code that runs faster and uses resources wisely.

Problem-Solving: Develop a deep understanding of how to approach and solve various types of problems.

Career Growth: Essential for technical interviews and improving coding skills.
